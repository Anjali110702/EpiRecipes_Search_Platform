Filtering by category and nutritional values (e.g., calories).
Pagination for smooth navigation through search results.
Attractive and user-friendly interface.
Dashboard to view categorized data and analytics.
Tech Stack
Frontend: React, React Router DOM, Font Awesome
Backend: Flask, OpenSearch
Database/Indexing: OpenSearch
Other Tools: Docker (for OpenSearch setup), Axios (for API requests), Pandas (for dataset handling)
Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:
Node.js (v14 or higher)
Python (v3.8 or higher)
Docker
OpenSearch (via Docker)
A web browser like Google Chrome

Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up the project locally.

Backend Setup (Flask & OpenSearch)
Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/epirecipes-search-platform.git
cd epirecipes-search-platform
Set Up OpenSearch via Docker: Use the provided Docker Compose file to set up OpenSearch.


docker-compose up
OpenSearch should now be running at http://localhost:9200.

Install Python Dependencies: Navigate to the backend folder and install the required Python packages:
Run the Flask Server: Once dependencies are installed, start the Flask server:

python app.py
The backend will run on http://localhost:5000.

Index the Dataset: Index the recipe dataset into OpenSearch by running the indexing script:
python index_large_recipes.py

Frontend Setup (React)
Navigate to the Frontend Folder: In your terminal, navigate to the React project directory:


cd epirecipes-search
Install Dependencies: Install the necessary Node.js packages using npm:


npm install
Start the React Development Server: Run the React app:


npm start
The frontend will be available at http://localhost:3000.

Running the Application
Once both the backend and frontend are running, you can visit http://localhost:3000 in your web browser to use the EpiRecipes Search Platform. From here, you can search for recipes, filter by categories or calories, and explore different recipes with ease.
